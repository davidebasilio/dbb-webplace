My name is Davide Basilio Bartolini and am currently a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.dei.polimi.it">Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione</a> of <a href="http://www.polimi.it">Politecnico di Milano</a>.
My advisor is <a href="http://home.dei.polimi.it/santambr/">Prof. Marco Domenico Santambrogio</a> and my PhD tutor is <a href="http://home.dei.polimi.it/sciuto/">Prof. Donatella Sciuto</a>.

I was born in <a href="http://g.co/maps/6dhj2">Brescia</a>, Italy on July 5, 1987 and I spent my first years with my family first in <a href="http://g.co/maps/cqtbx">Rino di Sonico</a>, Valle Camonica, and then moved to <a href="http://g.co/maps/7euqz">Provezze</a>, Franciacorta.
My education went all the way up to getting a high school diploma from <a href="http://http://www.madonnadellaneve.it/">Liceo Scientifico Madonna della Neve</a> in 2006 and then I enrolled to the bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.polimi.it">Politecnico di Milano</a>.
I achieved my B.Sc in 2009 and then enrolled in the joint master degree program in Computer Science and Engineering between Politecnico di Milano and <a href="http://www.uic.edu">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>; I spent the Fall 2010 semester at <a href="http://g.co/maps/9eu6b">Chicago, IL</a> and achieved a M.Sc degree from UIC in May 2011 and from Politecnico in December 2011.
My theses are publicly available in the <a href="?p=publications">publications section</a> of this website.
Right after graduating, in January 2012 I began my PhD at Politecnico and I am currently a third-year PhD student at the <a href="http://www.dei.polimi.it">Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione</a>.
In February 2015, I will join <a href="http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~thiele">Prof. Lothar Thiele</a>'s group at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch">ETH</a> as a postdoc researcher.

I am interested in computing systems research and I mainly deal with operating systems, autonomic computing, evolvable hardware, and embedded systems.
More information about my research can be found in the <a href="#science">science section</a>.
The <a href="#teaching">teaching section</a> contains material for courses that I taught at Politecnico di Milano during my PhD.
</p>

<p>
I am affiliated as a student member to the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81501670553&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=154862481&CFTOKEN=38047811">Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a> and to the <a href="http://www.hipeac.net/users/dbb">European Network of Excellence on High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation (HiPEAC)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apart from research, I practice rock climbing and mountaneering and I am a rock climbing instructor at <a href="http://www.caisem.org">CAI SEM</a> in Milano, Italy.
I am also interested in photography and music (I used to play piano and guitar, but I am not practicing very much).
The <a href=#images>images section</a> contains a few pictures I took, mainly from my climbing trips.
I used to enjoy writing fiction, but I haven't had much time for it in recent years; I'm trying to get back to it, I might post something in the <a href="#words">words section</a>.
